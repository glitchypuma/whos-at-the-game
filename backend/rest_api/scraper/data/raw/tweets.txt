#SpiderManAcrosstheSpiderVerse  https://t.co/aJ2PBUKULO 2 biggest adjustments Heat must make for NBA Finals Game 2 vs. Nuggets – NBA News https://t.co/ORRyFBCXKP É REAL NA NBA - No jogo de abertura da final da NBA, o Denver Nuggets derrotou o Miami Heat por 104 a 93, com destaque para o triplo-duplo de Nikola Jokic. 
Saiba mais sobre o jogo e confira o cronograma dos próximos jogos.

https://t.co/p5s8zG1m2T https://t.co/OuseIsHnBS @ClutchPointsApp Absolutely! The Nuggets have been underestimated and overlooked all season, but they've proven themselves to be a tough team. If the Heat can pull off a championship win, it'll be a true underdog story for the ages. Check my pin tweet bro @notcrypticno “heat vs nuggets is pure hoops y’all aren’t real fans” like dawg…sorry i didn’t wanna watch jokic and his squad bully ball the heat in 5 games lol Also, if you love Denver Game 2 a better bet than -370 Nuggets W is Jokic -280 double double &amp; Nuggets W. 
He’s should get over 10 in 2/3 whether it’s points, assists, or rebounds. 

Or you place in game bet if the Heat take an early 7/10 point lead. The Denver Nuggets show that simple can be dominant with their offense against the Miami Heat! Their defense also stepped up to stop the Heat from getting to the line. #NBA #DenverNuggets #MiamiHeat #Basketball https://t.co/lfKrmCgQMm I never met a Denver nuggets fan just a bunch of pple that don’t like the Heat 😂 @HPbasketball Predictions:
Gm 2 - Nuggs by 15 or more
Gm 3 - Heat execute &amp; control, Nuggs foul trouble, Heat by 7 - 12
Gm 4 - Great game, tons of lead changes, Nuggs pull it out by 3 or less
Gm 5 - close for a half, Jokic says F off and gets 40+ to secure the ring Draymond Green Predicts Gentleman's Sweep in Heat-Nuggets Finals https://t.co/z77ZgecQwS Nuggets are just playing better basketball then everyone else! Their making good teams look like shit… i hope heat puts a better fight next game and make it interesting atleast!!! @balldontstop I thinks it’s more so the nuggets are way better than the heat so it’s really not that interesting nor will be a good long series Je, Nuggets au Miami Heat kushinda Tanange hili?🤔

Jokic almost never gets into foul trouble. Your “bigs” are going to have to deal with him all series. Keep in mind, the Heat did shoot poorly, but so did the Nuggets. This is a wrap. @ESPNNBA @3MWD__ Heat not beating no damn Nuggets. Jokic logra un triple-doble, los Nuggets superan al Heat 104-93 en el Juego 1 de las Finales de la NBA

So probability-wise it’s the Nuggets but I still like the Heat. @BetMGM The Nuggets should be nervous,
Only won by 11 &amp; made 14 more free throws..The refs can't save them every game 🙏 💰
Game two should be a Heat win  bc
1) use 2 altitude
2) Himmy will show up
3) ditto for Caleb
4) Refs are on notice
#HEATCulture #HeatIn6  #NuggetsNation #NBAFinals @nuggets Heat in 6. At some point, Heat are gonna figure things. And I want them too. I love competitive basketball. They somehow got back in the game early in the 4th but Nuggets were too good to let go.

⬛️ Jokic owns Bam on both sides of the floor.

⬛️ Nuggets shot worse from 3 than the Heat and still blew them out.

⬛️ Nuggets took their foot off the gas after ~3 quarters and the Heat still couldn't get back into the game.

⬛️ Nuggets in 5. #Deportes | Los Nuggets derrotaron a los Heat y tomaron ventaja en las Finales

https://t.co/T0fkqyQgdl @Krus_h @joshgiddey You think the Nuggets shot well? MPJ went 2/11 from three. Both teams shot poorly, Nuggets completely dominated every other part of the game. Shooting varies in each game, but the Heat don't look like they can handle Denver's size at all. @r_gbretoux @RealSkipBayless Heat will be lucky to get 1. The nuggets probably had their worst playoff performance last night and still managed to lead by 24. They shot farther off their average from the 3 than the heat. The size mismatch will also continue to lead to fouls on the heat. #NuevoDía | 🏀Finales de la NBA | #Nuggets ganan el primero. @NBALatam, @NBAspain, @nuggets

This is the worst playoff game the nuggets have played so far. The heat shot far better from 3 than the nuggets and they also did about everything they could to defend the size mismatch. If I was miami I’d be worried I couldn’t beat the nuggets @NevaMiss24 @PCPBands @joshgiddey and the nuggets had a bad shooting night at the 3 point line.

Nuggets are a lot of fun to watch but man watching them take on the Heat is mad boring like holy shit might as well chalk up a 15-20pt lead for Denver every game @Zachppp Lol. Heat fans delusional. Heat don't stand a chance against the Nuggets. This right here. The nuggets didnt even play well. Neither did the heat but the nuggets still won by 11 and at no point in that game did it look like they were folding. @Dome_patrol12 @TheNBACentral This was probably the nuggets worst game of the post season and at one point they were up 24. Heat shot better from 3 than the nuggets and did about all they can to defend the size of the nuggets. You’re delusional if you think this was anywhere near their best game. Cope.

Do the Heat have any hope of striking back in Game 2?

https://t.co/KP21T4XTG0 @DraconickGaming why do they call it nba last night when you heat at nuggets and night at the last nba? &gt; LRT how could people think this finals is boring?  The Nuggets play like a well oiled machine and the Heat treat every possession as if they have a gun to the back of their head.  It's great! @justjosh_a You do also realize that the nuggets had their worst shooting game too right and the heat actually shot better from 3 than the nuggets. So if the nuggets shot what they normally do wed be having a 30 point blowout conversation right now. The Heat can't stop this from the Nuggets! https://t.co/FYeWcsLCmZ via @YouTube @taefrmnola @Telivist He didn’t have an easy route it just doesn’t seem like nuggets heat is a good matchup like the nuggets are clearly better Aaand the nuggets vs the heat aka my dinner for this evening The Miami Heat traveled west to face the Denver Nuggets in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, with both teams eager to secure a victory and gain an early advantage.

Parlay of Nuggets Game 1 &amp; series at -250 was a good hedge as was the Series -1 1/2 and -2 1/2. FanDual not even offering -1 1/2 now, but I saw a book at -265 so on that!
Nuggets 2-1 after 3 -110 looks good or 3-0 +142 @Wole_USS Nuggets are def better &amp; it showed last night. But i still think there is a way for the Heat to win this series. Nikola Jokić lideró el triunfo de los Nuggets sobre los Heat en las Finales de la NBA

https://t.co/fuMjvJCjG8 @fwflackoo Brooo.... at this point yeah, The Heat aren't as fluid as the Nuggets tbh 

Those people dey give me joy anytime dem dey play. @DNVR_Nuggets @johnnyhatchback He seems to playing minutes without Jokic now which was rare before this series, easier to do now w/Heat being small. #INTERNACIONAL | EL FAVORITO ESTUVO A LA ALTURA

Nuggets are looking unstoppable. I got Nuggets in 6 😭 Just putting this out there, the heat had taken only 2 free throws the entire game, while the nuggets had taken 20.

So Jimmy hanging his friends and family has a human being correlates to the heat being unprepared? Alright bro. The Nuggets were able to shake off the rust fairly quickly in last night's Game 1 victory. What adjustments can the Heat make to avoid falling into a 0-2 hole?

So if you’re counting on heat buckets to fall you might wanna expect that the nuggets buckets are gonna fall. The Miami Heat lose the first game of the NBA Finals against the Denver Nuggets.

https://t.co/Rn1qVRmU4H Yea as long as they don’t let Jimmy get off and they keep closing out well on Heat shooters then they can live with Bam putting up good numbers.  The Heat had a mediocre shooting night from three, but at the same time the Nuggets had an even worse shooting night from three.  Should be interesting to see what adjustments are made. @chebagnepapi @tmwarning @Nuggets_Brasil Pensei exatamente isso. Faltou bastante comunicação ontem pra defesa do Heat. Não consuma acontecer assim não @NBAMemes Definitely was a weird finals game 1, we still need to see how the rest of the series plays out, but I think if it was a different team like Bucks instead of heat then it would feel fine with two 1 seeds and superstars but nuggets alone arent as hyped as other teams WATCH+++Here's options for downloading or watching Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse streaming the full movie online for Free

#Nuggetwin @joshgiddey Truly don’t understand how someone can think watching Jokic and these nuggets boring. And if Heat haven’t shown you by now they got that dog in them and won’t go down easy idk what to tell you When did they start displaying conference seeding in the score bug during the NBA Finals? It’s almost as if they want to discredit the Nuggets whether they win or lose the series. If they have shown it recently, then excuse my inattentiveness.  #NBA #NBAFinals #Nuggets #Heat @PlaybookSN Heat were down 24

I think having that many empty possessions against the Nuggets is gonna spell doom for the Heat. I think you both agree, you’re just saying Spo might not change it, and you may be right. But I personally hope he can adjust it. The Heat be elite on defense and have the best coach in hoops and the Nuggets relentlessly abused Vincent last night lmao u cannot hide a small guard vs elite teams let alone one thats older #NuevoDía | 🏀Finales de la NBA | #Nuggets ganan el primero. @NBALatam, @NBAspain, @nuggets

If y’all wanted a more “entertaining” final, then tell the teams you wanted in the finals they should’ve won their series. The Nuggets and Heat took care of their business. Not their fault NBA “fans” fetishized a Lakers-Celtics final @DNVR_Nuggets Good game overall, wasn't tested. But expect the Heat to bring the heat in game 2
https://t.co/rp53sPZp0L My Best Bets For Heat vs. Nuggets Game 2️⃣ | SportsCenter https://t.co/FCqYfLeuEl Like i totally respect Jokic and what the nuggets are doing but.....

• Beat 8 Seed Minnesota in 5
• Beat 4 Seed Suns in 6 
• Beat 7 Seed Lakers in 4 
• 8 Seed Heat in the Finals

If the bubble ring didnt count this shouldnt either. @joshgiddey Or because the nuggets are simply too good for the Miami heat so it isn’t entertaining🤯 @SportsN37118642 Heat actually shot better from 3, despite the national narrative being they were the team that couldn’t shoot last night "Heat at Nuggets"

Nuggets are loaded.. Gonna be tough to beat no matter who’s coaching that team.. Fact he got this Heat team to the finals is crazy impressive Erik Spoelstra and Michael Malone are the last two coaches standing in the NBA playoffs. 

@donnovanbennett argues that the Raptors should look at what the Heat and Nuggets have done in their search for a new head coach: https://t.co/HSaiNrs4cg @TheReal2Ten @NBAMemes No you’re wrong. People who love basketball wanted to see a series where  both teams can win and most games be close. This heat and nuggets series ain’t it Nuggets take game 1 with a 104-93 victory. 

Can the Heat handle Denver? https://t.co/gx0yn4zwJr Let's face it. Many in the national media doubted the Nuggets and Heat so it's great that we got Mark Schlereth to discuss how the city of Denver is handling that. @Goomba_81 @GeraldBourguet NBA champions the past four seasons &amp; their defensive rating (DRtg) in the playoffs:

2019 Raptors: 4th DRtg
2020 Lakers: 6th DRtg
2021 Bucks: 1st DRtg
2022 Warriors: 6th DRtg

This year the Nuggets are 5th in DRtg and the Heat are 6th in DRtg currently. This Ja Morant stuff sucks, it sucks for the nuggets or heat because when one of them win the title the biggest story will be about Ja Morant and his idiotic behavior @nuggets Question….? Why doesn’t heat put Bam on Jokic? https://t.co/vcwllC1pUd Ken Jeong's half-court shots at last night's Nuggets-Heat game were hilariously bad 😭

https://t.co/LbuTfQNxNR
https://t.co/noFM2YsqAo @HazarianKrist I’ve watched the Nuggets and they’re a different team on the road “better playoffs”, but still average. 
The Heat role players will be better at home and Jimmy comes to play Sunday. 

Overreaction today and I must admit I’m down, but it’s 1 game. That's less than 1/3. The nuggets are supposed to win because on paper, the Miami heat literally have the worst team in nba history so make the finals. The most accomplished player on their team averages 21 points a game for his career. @L64375559 @cory9917 @KendrickPerkins Said that earlier on this topic, in one of my other Tweets. I said this was the defensive strategy needed to beat the Denver Nuggets. But the Heat may not have the talent to do so.

"The Nuggets Are Simply Too Good for the Heat"

Sports Illustrated is likely to regret this. @YoungPiccasso @BleacherReport heat beat the 2 best teams in the east. nuggets beat 2 very good teams in the suns and lakers, and as a warriors fan if we beat the lakers they probably would’ve beat us too. the clear best team in the league this year. i will hear no discrediting of this ring From the opening tip, it was clear the Nuggets’ size in the frontcourt was too much for the Heat to handle.

Erik Spoelstra, the king of playoff adjustments, has his work cut out for him.

@WillGuillory examines the options: https://t.co/OCZNmrzOne https://t.co/ON3ROlFaqA @CEtalks @SLAMonline Heat didn't really held Nuggets down to 104points... Nuggets did... As they shot 29% from 3...

#MiamiHeat #DenverNuggets #HEAT #Nuggets Boring or not, I do not care. I'd love witnessing a masterclass from Jokic and the Nuggets that would lead them to their first ever title.

But I'd love seeing the Heat try to avoid getting swept though. Game 1:

"This is Denver Nugget basketball,” Aaron Gordon said. “We find a mismatch, we exploit it, and we keep going to it.”

Jimmy Butler, who was held to his lowest-scoring game of the playoffs, left the Heat locker room with a Michelob Ultra in hand.

https://t.co/GjvZkgrIQD The Nuggets aren’t even a boring team. Is the Finals boring because LeBron and Steph aren’t in it? Cause the Heat beat the Bucks and Celtics?  Nuggets honestly staring at an all time great post season run and y’all keep saying “boring”. Do y’all like the sport or not Miami Heat were out scored by 17 in the first half yesterday.

The Denver Nuggets got off to a blazing start EXACTLY like I told @gregohsilver on his podcast… or maybe I said the exact opposite 😅

https://t.co/BkokFnkDsV NBA FINALS: Jokic, Nuggets cruise to Game 1 win over Heat https://t.co/o5NbFqrHCs @Manny83161828 @ClutchPointsApp You might understand better why the Heat didn't shoot well after watching this. I've queued it up for you.

Rigging games I see On Thursday night Nikola Jokic outplayed Jimmy Butler in game one of the #NBAFinals. Which of these two will put up better numbers in this series? #Heat #Nuggets https://t.co/aIVNxVs2sb Nuggets are gonna SWEEP THE HEAT 💯 Good luck to the Miami Heat as they take on the Joker and the Denver Nuggets in the NBA finals… $braveheart1911 @PatMcAfeeShow @BillWalton Good luck to the Miami Heat as they take on the Joker and the Denver Nuggets in the NBA finals… $braveheart1911 @BrooklynGuy2021 Heat contestou bem os arremessos do nuggets, é bem mais provável eles chutaram pouco melhor, do que o Martin e o Strus ficarem 1/17 ou perto disso de novo Gonna be some Heat on them Nugget’s 
https://t.co/jOgFOofsPo never seen an easier triple dub. his off the ball/in transition defense is cheeks, but his ability to see things before they happen, his efficient scoring, heat missed shots, but denver really took they foot off the gas in the 4th. heat could get 1, but i still see nuggets in 4🤷🏽‍♂️ We’ve seen Jokic’s game before. Imagine a prime Arvydas Sabonis in the 90’s NBA #nuggets #heat #NBAFinals https://t.co/Hvhsb7EnRK We can’t say the Heat aint got a chance to win until we see them play atleast close to they best game and the Nuggets play close to they best game in the same game 💯 bc if Strus go 0/7 (a starter) Duncan Robinson go 1/7 and Caleb Martin go 1/7 I guess they don’t got a chance🤷🏾‍♂️💯 @Manny83161828 @ClutchPointsApp Our shooters are better. And they're not short.

We were #1 in the NBA through most of the season. It's cute the Heat have gone on a run playing against disorganized teams. They're having to work now. It's different.

Heat won't be ice cold from the field every game, need to rotate to perimeter coverage better and continue to out rebound them. Bench needs to adjust to their zone. @BigDriveSpence Facts! It’s funny. People just tweet stuff with ZERO knowledge.

Heat shot 33% from 3, just a hair below their season avg of 34%.

Nuggets shot 29.6%, which was WELL below their season avg of 37.9%. A full team effort powered the Nuggets to a 1-0 series lead in the #NBAFinals 

Sandy Clough and @BruceHaertl saw some things from the Heat that they can build on for Game 2, though.

🔗https://t.co/FR008hgyqt @KBknowsball @KJTreyy Nope sorry you’re not a real basketball fan since you didn’t want Nuggets Heat 🤓🤓 @TheNBACentral Defensively, the Heat are better with Martin than they are with Herro. About the same offensively if Martin can keep up his insane shooting. I don't think he will be able to keep his crazy shooting in this series against the Nuggets and they may suffer as a result of that. The Nuggets' 104 points in Game 1 was their second-fewest in the playoffs (their low was 97 in Game 2 against PHX) and the 93 points they gave up to the Heat was the third-fewest they've allowed all postseason (80 in Game 2 vs. MIN, 87 in Game 2 vs. PHX). @YeahWrld @MrLiveNLearnn @Rygu36 @ConologueColby @PlaybookSN Of course size matters when it comes to guarding jimmy jrue and smart to small for him. But ima heat fan so it’s heat in 6-7 and you a nuggets fan so I know it’s bugs all day for you @krassenstein Everybody is screaming “GO NUGGETS!” or “GO HEAT!” I’m screaming, “GO ROBERT MUELER AND THE RULE OF LAW!” RT if you agree! @ESPNNBA The NBA is using magnets rims against the Miami Heat that how they are missing open shots they was making all playoffs. Because the NBA has to use magnets rims against the Miami Heat because the Denver Nuggets will be losing by 40 points. Rigging games I see “You can’t keep firing coaches because their teams don’t win championships.”

The Heat and Nuggets show that not being reactionary to postseason heartbreak can pay off, @davidaldridgedc writes.

Jimmy said it himself--they didn't earn trips to the line. They didn't put pressure on the rim. They earned 2 free throws.

#lavozdelanoticiard https://t.co/SbXneXN22e @llMaizll @samninjapro @SLAMonline I do agree this is true, in principle. An ideal Jokic game is something like 30/15/15. Changing it to 50/15/6 is a better outcome.

But he's largely figured out how to prevent that. That's what the Heat tried. It didn't work. The Nuggets looked good in game one. Did the Heat figure anything out?

I’m sure a lot of the 1st finals appearance jitters played into some misses. I think not being afraid to get in the paint. They were on fire there &amp; struggled shooting 3s. Denver is the #1 offense against zone defense. They can break the Heat there. No doubt. @nathanmarzion Supported Knicks against Heat but rooted Heat against Boston. All Nuggets now. Game 2:

The heat  time has come to an end against the Denver Nuggets, I chose this team because it's a very solid team to play against but all I can really say is Nuggets in 4 or 5. Adam Silver passed up on Year 20 Lebron, Steph and Warriors Last Dance, KD and Phoenix....Race for 18 with Lakers v Boston, Embiid vs Jokic, Boston coming back down 0-3..

https://t.co/wUbKj4y0zh @DNVR_Nuggets I counted about 20 Zone possessions for the Heat, about 1.6 pts per possession. Not too shabby. We could do better. They played zone most of the time when Jok was off the floor. Find a way to deal with the Zone when Jok sits. Murray iso’s mustn’t be the only solution. Heat fans have a strong case for the Heat shooting much better and how the game would be different.

Nuggets as well...lots of missed open 3s. 

Game 2 will be telling. More zone possessions strung together. Nuggets get an open corner 3 out of it. Heat will have to adjust how and when they use the zone in Game 2. https://t.co/MtfsTrGgkh @investwithshy @MJ_McRae @Plugss_ @bronhistory Lol including this season not giving the heat their two finals appearances and putting a 0 next to nuggets and heat titles even tho one of them has to win Heat fans are sitting in their cars rn praying to Donald Trump to save them from the Nuggets … @BeMore27 and nikola jokic unleash their inner Handsome Dancer after double doubling the Heat and leading the @nuggets to victory in game 1 of the @nba finals.

MPJ is 6'10" for Christ's sake.  Did you see Vincent trying to guard AG 1 on 1?  Looked like a big brother/little brother situation.  Butler was scared to go to the rack, too. @DontaSpeight8 @NBA Definitely rigged. The refs gave the Nuggets 20 free throws and only gave the Heat 2..... And They weren't playing Jimmy Butler.... Adam Silverstein definitely called up Jimmy that morning and told him to cool it Dayummm niggas ain’t say the heat only shot 2 free throws last night 😂 n the nuggets shot 20 @HUSTLERSDEPOT The Nuggets never won in franchise history, and buck the Heat 🤷🏽‍♂️😂 Check out my latest for @SBNation - The Miami Heat are one of the best stories in NBA Playoffs history. But the Denver Nuggets are about to teach them that not all stories have happy endings. https://t.co/p9CH34pE5Z Miami heat vs Denver nuggets is going to be the least viewed and the most boring finals in the history of NBA.  

#NBA #MiamiHeat #Denver #jokic #jimmybutler watching espn... the heat can really beat the nuggets if they make some changes @jeffwills08 Also Lakers almost beat the Nuggets while only having 1 day breaks in between each game.

https://t.co/K3swK8bjai this finals dont feel the same without Stephen Curry. Nuggets vs Heat is boring af. If only the @NBA fairly called that gsw vs lal series...smh. @jeffwills08 Last night gave me hope that the Heat will win in 7. After a weeks rest the Nuggets barely scraped by a win. The Lakers &amp; Heat barely had rest and almost got g1 vs Nugs. The rest of the series has 2 day breaks. Heat will come back more rested. I have faith they can win this. This Sunday game 2 heat vs nuggets The Heat took 17 more shots from the field than the Nuggets last night and shot a higher 3P% than Denver as well with MPJ only shooting 2-11 from deep.

You sure? All this narrative bullshit is so fuckin dumb. 

"Butler didn't get going, this was an encouraging sign for the Heat to be in the game."

They weren't in the game, Nuggets even play good and if its about moral victories, Lakers swept Nuggets....yet didn't win a fuckin single game Heat vs. Nuggets: Miami comes out flat in NBA Finals opener, but there are reasons hope should not be lost

Heat, Bucks, Sixers, Warriors, Suns e Nuggets tão mt bem servidos #NBA #Finals #Heat #Nuggets https://t.co/1T2gg4jUoR Miami Heat had played 20 games this postseason and closed out the Celtics on May 29th. 

Denver Nuggets had played 15 games and had been off since May 22nd. 

Game 1 was bound to be an easy W for the Nuggets. Look for game 2 to be close with the Heat taking games 3/4 in Miami. @flasportsbuzz The NBA is using magnets rims against the Miami Heat that how they are missing open shots they was making all playoffs. Because the NBA has to use magnets rims against the Miami Heat because the Denver Nuggets will be losing by 40 points. Rigging games I see Whole HEAT squad gotta adjust to the aggressive POA defense the Nuggets showed. Especially Duncan. He has no breathing room in those DHO’s.

-Nuggets always take their foot off the grass when they’re up by a lot. And they still pull it out.

If the Heat were playing the Lakers or Warriors, i would be pulling for them.  Nuggets are small market like our Bucks, and have never won a title.  So that makes it VERY easy to root for Denver Read "Celtics fans are sick after Heat forwards Caleb Martin, Max Strus combine for brutal NBA history in Game 1 vs. Nuggets" on SmartNews: https://t.co/TOmxlsr95d #SmartNews I’d be willing to bet a decent amount that neither of those doofuses have watched a single Heat/Nuggets game all year before now. @nuggets Heat in 5 Some of the Heat's role players were much less efficient against the Nuggets. https://t.co/zDcEVNCo7m 💰 Want to win FREE money?

That's just the way sports works. @RaptorsSlander @SLAMonline Shot better from 3 than Denver and still got dominated all game long 😭

Sliver doesn’t want the media to take away from the Heat-Nuggets convos with this story that’s gonna probably be the biggest story going into the NBA next season.

According to Nielsen, Game 1 of Heat Nuggets was viewed in about 33,000 fewer Miami-Fort Lauderdale homes than Game 7 of Heat Celtics on Monday. Understandably, Nikola Jokic &amp; Jamal Murray get all of the major headlines for the Denver Nuggets. 

But Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon were the X-factors in last night’s convincing victory over the Miami Heat.

JJ spittin' facts back to 1987.  Saying Heat have "no answer" &amp; are getting "punished". Let us know (in an NBA Finals gm) while a team is dominating, the last time they had 3 players still play over 40min.  Lack of depth will be there undoing. Heat Nuggets is not only a great NBA Final, it’s also a terrific quick dinner recipe! Cara, é isso. O Nuggets sempre tem resposta. SEMPRE! 

Entendo o Miami estar confiante com um time que foi muito abaixo nas bolas de três com Struss e Martin. Mas, convenhamos... Não deve ser isso que salvará o Heat. .@Foxworth24 can’t believe the Heat are even trying zone defense against the Nuggets and @bomani_jones says zone is for “cowards”.

He was effective but it’s better if he attacks Jokic at the rim. Mix it up a little.

We made them feel comfortable defensively, that can’t happen. @mit_philly_fan @KGsGOAT very true but thats the same with the Nuggets as they r the best offense in the NBA &amp; also I don't think we should expect the Heat to continue to rebound this well against the Nuggets considering how dominant they have been on the glass all year Reading all this national Nuggets disrespect simple fact of the matter is the starters for the Heat minus Jimmy Butler would be bench players for the Nuggets #TeLoResumo Denver Nuggets logra cómoda victoria sobre Miami Heat en su debut en las finales de la NBA #NBAFinals #DenverNuggets #MiamiHeat https://t.co/pzs7tWTjlT #2Jun | #NBAFinals #NBA | Denver Nuggets 🆚 Miami Heat

Miami 96 tiros vs 79 Denver... pero con 40% de efectividad de nada sirvió. 
Los Nuggets usaron menos el perímetro y así sumaron 16/20 TL vs solo 2/2 del Heat, la mínima histórica en playoffs. ¡Denver ganó su 1er partido en Finales NBA! 104-93 y el Heat no tuvo nada que hacer frente a la intensidad defensiva y la eficacia en ataque de los Nuggets.
Gran 1era mitad con 60% de campo y el Joker en 10 pts + 10 ast, el 2do en lograrlo en 25 años, junto a Lebron en 2017. @PaigeSpiranac @PointsBetUSA Nuggets in four. Just a really solid team.

Heat in 5. Nuggets let us hang around without making a damn shot. I’m confident, gotta go get game two.

Miami Heat at Denver Nuggets
Date/Time: Jun 4 2023 8:00 PM EDT
Play Rating: 4%
Play: Total Over 214.5 (-110) 2-3 Zone W/O Jokic - Nuggets were ready for this, attacking soft spots in the 2-3, great rotation by the Heat until a bad Highsmith close out leads to a Murray step back three https://t.co/Cq4h7joKCx 🏆NBA Finals Preview🏆

🏀 Visual to show Heat's zone against the Nuggets
📊 Dove into some Computer Vision to detect zone defense in game 1

🎥Film thread below⬇️⬇️ https://t.co/BYasb1hSiJ You're telling me we watched the Lakers and the Heat beat the two most recent championship teams (with relative ease), but them being play-in teams discredits the Nuggets run. Holy fuck, that's insane to think. On Friday's edition of WagerTalk Today, Andy Lang and Jay Money join Steve and Teddy for a look at Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the Nuggets and Heat. Ralph Michaels stops by to preview the College World Series. https://t.co/hW3mMj97wA @nuggets oh and jokics moving screens are just something the heat are going to have to play through. @Vampsidian @saphinical “THE DENVER NUGGETS HAVE WON THEIR FIRST NBA CHAMPIONSHIP IN FRANCHISE HISTORY IN A 4-0 SWEEP AGAINST THE MIAMI HEAT” *watches Jokic and the Nuggets cook the Heat last night*

But I guarantee it it were Lakers Celtics @ColinCowherd wouldn't be on vacation. @HPbasketball No point of saying Heat shot horrendously without saying Nuggets too and very probably even worse because they are a better shooting team. @BdonDC_8203 @KerrickDuchy Nah I mean it’s stupid to put money on the Heat when you think the Nuggets win Only hope the Heat have is to shoot as well as they did in the Bucks series and Games 1-3 of the Celtics series cos there's not a single basket balling thing they do better than the Nuggets to win 4 of the next 6 @majestietestie @VersaceOeufs @AtomicOVO @HeyArnold2335 @Herrojuku So MJ isn't smart enough to run an offense with a lot of ball movement to beat zone defense? Also you don't think MJ can't read the defense and find the open man? This is MJ joining the 2023 Heat replacing Jimmy not the 1996 Bulls playing the Nuggets. The Darion Hopkins Show Ep.33 | Heat Vs Nuggets Gm 1 Recap, https://t.co/EtnynJjZ0b Jokic logra un triple-doble, los Nuggets superan al Heat 104-93 en el Juego 1 de las Finales de la NBA https://t.co/yrNz1LmgUV vía @elcorreodo The Denver Nuggets’ offense was a riddle that the Miami Heat couldn’t solve. https://t.co/xAfRSzMhVB Share your questions/comments for “Hey, Jones!” Topics: Jokic and Nuggets cruise past Heat in Game 1; more impending cfb expansion, who you'd want to see in Big Ten; how college football should be structured if we're headed for two super-conference model.

Heat fan turned Nuggets fan? 🤔 https://t.co/a65CY3Dwz0 The Denver #Nuggets had a dominant performance against the Miami #Heat, as they won 104-93. Denver had a great offensive performance, led by Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray who combined for 53 points #NBAFinals 

Murray: 26 PTS, 10 AST, 6 REB
MPJ: 14 PTS, 13 REB, 2 BLK

Gordon: 16 PTS, 7-10 FG
Bam: 26 PTS, 13 REB, 5 AST Miami Heat held The Nuggets

The Celtics lost to this trash heat team. The whole East did. Just because they play team ball and are a team. Look at how trash they are against a team with talent that plays team ball in the nuggets.

I expect Nuggets O to get better, Heat D stay the same or worse and Heat to make buckets. All those things still have Jokic with a trip-dub *Meant to say Nuggets not Heat ¡CON JOKIC ESTELAR!

After looking like Kawhi vs. the Celtics in the Conference Finals, is it smart to fade him for this series?

#calebmartin #heat #nuggets #nbafinals #NBATwitter https://t.co/ky4CpUIs7M Somebody asked me who I had last night I said nuggets they want to go on and argue and still bet on the heat... Chile 🤣🤣🤣 I be knowing. Real stats bettor baby Jokic gets triple-double, Nuggets roll past Heat 104-93 in Game 1 of NBA Finals https://t.co/rWEcNqKCBP Heat on offense. Nuggets mixed in different coverages. Sometimes Jokic in drop, other times at screen level. Seemed personnel based. Against Butler, Jokic dropped. Butler engages Jokic in PnR, hits Bam in rhythm. https://t.co/03lpKc8yOT I heard a lot of talk about how the Heat need to fix their shooting and things will work out, but they were one of the worst 3 point shooting teams in the regular season and the Nuggets shot WORSE from 3 in game 1. This feels like it will be a landslide. Domingo de Heat vs Nuggets 🙏 NBA Finals Mascot Review:

The Denver Nuggets mascot is Rocky who is a Mountain Lion.

The Miami Heat Mascot is Burnie and he appears to be some type of a Q*bert.

In this matchup of mascots, the Denver Nuggets appear to have the edge.

#NBAFinals #NBA #Mascots #Nuggets #Heat https://t.co/A6vI8lCc3h @vincentwhwong @mkhoops You take those shots over the two man game getting whatever it wants. Heat let Celtics shoot themselves out of games. Need to do the same to nuggets when Jokic and Murray are on the floor Heat-Nuggets rewatch thread on some things I'm keeping an eye on in Game 2.

First, I thought Miami should try to play Jokic one-on-one and turn him into a scorer. Wasn't necessarily the case. Jimmy Butler was often used as help defender on doubles. Gordon gets a wide open shot https://t.co/wPA1z5HvIE We were robbed of Celtics v Nuggets because heat bums played good for 1 series Heat were the best team in the East these playoffs, but also the worst matchup out of the Bucks-Celtics-Heat to go against the Nuggets IMO @IRIE @starrylemonlime @MiamiHEAT The bandwagon is the perfect name for this because Heat fans are the fakest in America I forgot the Nuggets said ok we wanna play the Lakers T Wolves and Heat, oh and on top of all the ask can we beat the Suns too? 

Goofy @Greenmachine17_ The Heat know what they are up against. Nuggets are not playing with them. Paul Klee: On a grand night in Nuggets history, Game 1 suggests short NBA Finals with Miami Heat https://t.co/Ed8Y7DMHdw käyttäen @DenverGazette This was the difference in the game in my opinion. And the lack of FTA. The loss was more on what the Heat didn’t do versus what the Nuggets did. anyone saying the nuggets look like the better team after last nights game doesn’t know ball in the slightest. heat in 6.

#NBAFinals #BringItIn https://t.co/T6mRpPIAcd @BariAWilliams 4. Too big and strong. Heat had excellent looks and even if they fell Nuggets look superior. [UPDATE] Miami Heat +8.0 (+8.5) at Denver Nuggets | Sun 20:00ET #MIAvsDEN #NBA ~ https://t.co/YApOSZCB6H @HeatBetter Yeah u can’t get 13 points from him. Nuggets too good offensively. Probably need Martin to just resemble some type of offense like he did vs the Celtics. Nuggets are a complete team, heat gonna have to grind this series out @Ibra_Goat What’s hilarious is the fact that y’all lost and yet you still think Tatum-Jokic matchup is better; if you can’t handle the Heat, what makes you think you could handle the nuggets? Which team are you rooting for - Heat, Nuggets, or Tongs? Join the conversation and share your NBA Finals preferences! #NBAFinals #BBQ&amp;grill Jimmy Butler's USG% last night was 18.0

It was his lowest of the playoffs. He only had 5 games in the regular season with a lower USG%. 

HEAT looks were generally good but they were on Nuggets terms. Jimmy &amp; others certainly need to be more forceful in game 2. #SinCortapisa Los Nuggets de Denver agita al Heat de Miami y toma ventaja en las Finales.

That’s why it’s a boring finals.

I love jimmy and the heat but unless the team shoots 45% from 3 in 4 games there is really not a chance I think. I hate to say that but Joker is different and the nuggets team is just amazing Will the  nuggets cool down the heat, or overheat spark savour the  nuggets

#NBA #NBAPlayoffs #NBAFinals https://t.co/KoI1Ci6vE7 "I'd take that game from Jokic the entire series. That's as well as you're gonna do against the Denver offense...AND, the Heat will lose in 4 if the Nuggets get Bam to shoot mid-range jumpers the entire time." – Dan

📺  https://t.co/ZhaQNN9Odt https://t.co/uNuAxs9d5N @Heatfan_0012 @JaredZero_NBA @catchflames Speaking of dignity… you need to take some losses yourself, because the Nuggets are cool down the Heat.

Saying the Denver Nuggets actually lost last night and the Heat are in prime position to sweep the Nuggets in the NBA Finals. In here: Did the Heat find some answers vs. Nuggets' elite off-ball movement? Did the Heat simply miss a bunch of open shots? And putting Jimmy Butler's quiet performance in perspective. @Dr_Nut_ This reminds me of the time I tried to heat up my chicken nuggets with the hotel room blow dryer. @ZachLowe_NBA The only chance Heat have is if the Nuggets just go ice cold.  And even then I’m not sure they can win The Heat took what they could get. The Nuggets took whatever the hell they wanted.

Basketball nerds were so focused on calling everyone a 'casual' when people were weary about getting a Nuggets-Heat series without realising it was an incredible mismatch of size and talent and now you have a blowout in a Final. Congrats on being snobs everyone 👏🏾 The size advantage of the #Nuggets was really noticeable in Game 1 of the #NBAFinals. The #Heat are giving up like 15-20 pounds and a couple inches of height in most of the primary matchups. And the size they do have to pull off the bench is...

https://t.co/eGanFE5I7I National sports media is so bitter that their beloved #Lakers &amp; #Celtics lost, they're seeking vindication by pulling 4 a #Nuggets sweep or domination of the #Heat. This way it proves that the #Lakers were beaten by the best team in the league &amp; the #Celtics loss was a fluke. 5/16 sur les wide open 3s. Le Heat a généré beaucoup de bons tirs, il faut "juste" les rentrer. Les Nuggets étaient à 3/9 (12.8 tentés en moyenne sur ces PO). Nuggets W last night. They likely take game 2 as well

Heat were not as aggressive, &amp; the team that is typically gets rewarded. @HeatBetter Did everything go wrong. Heat made more 3’s, had less turnovers and the nuggets best shooters didn’t shoot well. Y’all should feel good though with bam aggressiveness and the looks he got. Jimmy gotta go crazy @KryntNBA Idk maybe because the size of the nuggets is laughable compared the heat? And they are a much better team?

https://t.co/dMwMLLJ9qw As for bad omens, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver saying he will save money by sharing the results of the Ja Morant survey    until after the Finals because it would be unfair to the Denver nuggets And miami heat is pretty bad.

https://t.co/hA5maGc1Yr https://t.co/GcUM83JzR4 Good question but it’s kinda like asking were the Heat better than the Bucks , Knicks and Celtics thru the first 3 rounds . On PAPER we’re not as good as those 3 teams the Lakers or the Nuggets . But once you play the game … we saw what was up ….. Overpaying for concerts (T Swift) &amp; ballgames. Cubs &amp; White Sox poopy nuggets. Alex Verdugo deserved ejection for losing bat. Heat crap bed in Game 1. It's all here. 
https://t.co/4yXYqAqkyB "The city is absolutely on fire."

@byesline joins @AndyScholesCNN to discuss Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the Denver Nuggets and Miami Heat. https://t.co/jYGtXEW9ws heat this, nuggets that 🙄 we get it, you smoke weed @jlsinna It is encouraging that we only lost by 11 pts and Heat only got to the line 2 times compared to Nuggets 20X. Little sus that Eric Lewis being investigated and Heat suddenly have record low FT attempts. Just a reminder. 

The Heat was off last night. Nuggets had 18 more FTs. 
Nuggets only won by 11. 

Do with that what you will 🫣 From @TheAthletic: It took the Nuggets 47 seasons of NBA basketball to reach a finals. Now that they’re finally in one, they’re wearing it well. Denver was dominant from start to finish in a 104-93 win over the Miami Heat in Game 1. https://t.co/TxiHTomiRN @KGsGOAT The heat had wide open looks and the defense was good we just missed our shots nuggets ain't like that fr Miami Heat last night getting surprised. 😆 Denver Nuggets gon sweep this putas https://t.co/RTju5pvlmp @CoachCotreau @KendrickPerkins Sure, in an ideal scenario for the Heat. But the Nuggets can and likely will play MUCH better than that. You ain't seen nothing yet if you're a Heat fan and haven't watched much Western b-ball. Nuggets were RUST-Y. Without a doubt.  Not even the nuggets fault, no one wanted to see the heat in the finals outside of their fan base @NBAMemes Go climb in a Box. And know the Nuggets are dismantling a Very good Heat Team. Respect ALL In my mind the Nuggets have multiple paths to victory and a more flexible lineups . The heat being more limited have to play their game to have a chance to win. I think that advantage will play itself out over the course of the series. @DariusJohnsonTV And I’m here for every bit of it. Mike is a heat fan first and Nuggets second so it’s been hard GET IN ON THIS:

https://t.co/6LoYEvjbUT @HPbasketball The Heat having to use their best wing defender to guard what's arguably the 4th or 5th offensive option on the floor seems pretty ideal for the Nuggets Nah not me i was rooting for the heat to make it to the finals but lose to the nuggets. This way jokic gets his and giannis legacy saved 😂 This possession was a thing of beauty and is a great example of how HEAT can hurt the Nuggets with constant motion moving forward. https://t.co/h6uraKDRDN @ESPNNBA AG came out wanting to take the heart of the heat - crazy how strong this nuggets roster is How to Watch 2023 Formula 1 | F1 Spanish GP Live Stream 4K

https://t.co/hoc6gPNslF heat nuggets @SouichiTerada I wouldn’t call it cheering for the Nuggets. I’d call it rooting against the Heat. Maybe a slight distinction, but that’s where I’m at If AD can't completely guard the Nuggets inside, what makes ya think the heat can 🤧 Nuggets 1 - 0 Miami heat 😱🏀💥
Nikola Jokic: 27 pts, 10 reb, 14 ast.

#basketball #nba #baloncesto #nbaontnt #nbaonespn @CaracolTV  #basket #deportes @GolCaracol #deporte #WNBA #ball #nbalatam #nbaallstar https://t.co/vWSKiC8Rvp @NBAdabad @brunorsmussi zikou o celtics e agr vem zikar o heat, parabéns nuggets pelo título That’s not supposed to be credit for the Heat. I’m just confused why Celtics fans who struggled against the Sixers and lost to Heat would be more competitive for the Nuggets than Miami. @Krabs_Bets @lukasarthur11 Better advice is to throw 200 bucks on heat to win the series at +300 so that even if the nuggets lose you’re still making 500 bucks, and if they win you’re still making 900. That way you can pay for your ticket and still guarantee you’re going to be in the green either way @LucaasAraujoXD Pior que eu boto fé que dá pra ser disputado os jogos.
O Heat ontem tava errando quase tudo de três e isso fez muito falta no final.
Mas o jogo dos Nuggets parece tão encaixadinho que tbm é difícil ver eles perdendo jogos. 🏀: El segundo partido de las Finales NBA 2023 se jugará el próximo domingo, entre Heat y Nuggets en la ciudad de Denver, Colorado a las 6:00PM, tiempo del centro de México.

Hahaha @DonScorsese Are you watching the NBA finals? I'm rooting for the Denver Nuggets. That Jokic guy is out of this world and I can't stand the Heat The Nuggets comfortably beat the Heat in the Game 1 of NBA Finals 😳

@augis04 analyzed how they were simply too big for Miami &amp; how Nikola Jokic dominated without shooting the ball:

https://t.co/HjM2soSOKm Heat Star Jimmy Butler was held to just 13 pts last night. Miami role players Caleb Martin, Max Strus, and Duncan Robinson combine for just 6 pts on 2/23 FGs and 2/16 from 3... Nuggets only won by 11 pts. Game 2 is going to be alot more competitive imo #NBAFinals 【NBAファイナル生観戦】

Good to see CB get in some minutes. Heat will be better next game. @currypistonn As a nuggets fan, the Heat embarrassed the East. One of the most well deserved and hard earned finals appearance of all time. It's not the refs fault Heat shot only 2 free throws. It's Nuggets defense.

They just destroyed the Lakers in 4 games. The Heat have already won by making the finals as an 8th seed. The Heat need to add bigger guards, that's always been an issue.

Nikola Jokic did what he does best and set up his teammates for success as Denver took down the Heat in Game 1. https://t.co/3QnuzGMcot Heat at Nuggets! Hut hut hike! Slam dunk! Go Numbats!

Why, Twitter, why? @PepeBrasin ¿Pepe, no le das una oportunidad al Heat frente a estos Nuggets? 

El Heat jugó este juego muy por debajo en sus eficiencias: 26 triples fallados, la mayoría abiertos. Jimmy sin atacar el aro, solo 2 FT. Struss 0/10 y 0pts, Caleb 1/7 y 3pts

Imposible ganarle así a nadie. The Nuggets are too big and too powerful for Heat in NBA Finals https://t.co/K6ngUXGJpz @KendrickPerkins That was the Nuggets C game at best. They shot under 30% from 3, which they never do. A career 40% shooter (MPJ) went 2-11. They didn't run. They only scored 104 and still went wire to wire double digits. That was the Heat's chance to win one. @SportsCenter Denver Nuggets r poised to win their 1st Larry O'Brien NBA Finals Championship 🏆 trophy after 47 yrs in the league.

Nobody can dispute that it's about time. After almost 50 yrs., Denver is due a hoops crown. The Heat already have their 3.

Lakers are a better team than miami too. LeBron &amp; AD said this Nuggets team is the best team they have played since they joined up in LA in 2020. Sorry. Heat have no chance. Nuggets as is are already well keyed in on everything the Heat want this possession. Alert for the Caleb Martin curl off the initial Duncan Robinson screen. Reacting to the Robinson ghost screen before it actually happens next. Anticipating Butler wanting to draw attention in to kick out to the top of the key or Martin for a 3 after that. It just gets that much harder when Denver gets to play 5 on 4 and Jokic can shade and overload enough to take away angles. The Nuggets really had three players bringing the ball up the court and the Heat could do nothing to capitalize on it Los Denver Nuggets sometieron con autoridad a los Miami Heat para tomar ventaja en la lucha por el anillo de la NBA 104-93, dejando 1-0 en la serie.

The Nuggets shot 29.6%from three, which was WELL below their season avg of 38%

If anything won’t happen again, it’s the reverse of what you are saying. Bottom line The "HEAT" left the damn "H" in MIAMI, and for that, the "NUGGETS" were able to "EAT" their asses up. 
This was corny, but I'm no writer. This scene is nothing new for Miami, so stop making excuses for them and give credit where it's due in game 1, and let's go #2. @FeelLikeDrew Everyone watching has seen the Heat's best. Nuggets starting 5 has been the best all-season, so all things playing out, Heat just don't have much of a chance. Jokic was no joke😱in NBA Finals Game 1:

https://t.co/l5dPWtXmU1 #NBAFINALS || EL BIG THREE DE LOS NUGGETS ES UNA LOCURA 😱😱

Los Nuggets en su primer partido en unas finales de la NBA se impusieron ante el Heat 104-93 y lideran 1-0.

El 'joker' convirtió un triple doble y estableció récord de asistencias para un pívot en las finales con 14. https://t.co/eHe7yylSKE Nuggets dominan al Heat 104-93 en primero de Finales de la NBA https://t.co/nWHUZfZRTJ So the overall sentiment I see online is that the Heat missed wide open shots, yet:

- Heat wide open 3s: 5/16 (31%)
- Nuggets wide open 3s: 3/9 (33%)

People just got used to them shooting roughly 60% on wide open 3s :) Finales NBA: Con un brillante Jokic, Denver Nuggets se quedó con el primer juego ante Miami Heat https://t.co/Hp748InZNk vía @RADIO FOX 107.1 Mhz Nuggets  vs Heat Game1の見逃し配信視聴完了。

#NBA2K23 #nba2k23myteam #NBA2K https://t.co/BTFN7CJz8b I want the Nuggets to win but the Heat shot like shit last night and Bam absolutely feasted. It wasn't a close game but I wouldn't call the series finished. I actually was just saying that if the Nuggets win game one they take the whole series, but they kept it a ten point game on what seemed to be 3% 3pt shooting and Jokic was having a lot of trouble with Bam. You would think everyone who isn't a Nuggets fan would be rooting for the underdog 8 seed 

Heat hate really is generational @johnewing @BetMGM @MiamiHEAT @nuggets Betting on the heat is a donation @NBAMemes Its boring only because i think the Nuggets are a lot better the Heat. This could be a sweep or Heat could win 1 game @PaigeSpiranac @PointsBetUSA Those are definitely not Nuggets.. Miami Heat seakers yes but definitely not Denver Nuggets!

Nuggets vs Heat is objectively more entertaining and interesting than LA vs BOS would ever have been. I'm convinced a lot of you guys don't even like watching basketball As the crowd goes wild, the Denver #Nuggets, in their first #NBAFinals appearance in franchise history, let the clock run out as they defeat the Miami #Heat to win Game 1.

Denver stays undefeated in these playoffs at home and in Game 1s, and are now 13-3 this postseason. https://t.co/TRFtV05gWw @j2110_ I already took that FD special nuggets to win in 4 or 5 games +110 for 2 units so I’m not sure if I wanna take anything else yet might just bet the heat moneyline some of these games Lastly, I believed the @OfficialNBARefs would have their thumb on the scales against the @nuggets.  Part of me still believes that.  The @NBA always has an agenda. 

#Nuggets will beat the #Heat to win their first championship.  This is a great thing for Colorado &amp; for pro hoops. @FirstTake I agree on mix match in size , Denver was def better team last night.  I will let you know my concern, “Nuggets looked Fresh” I’d look fresh if I had 10 days off at HOME.  Heat had TWO days off playing a Game 7.  Ppl need to settle down. https://t.co/NliguHd1M7 I was making fun of y’all because y’all ain’t want Nuggets and Heat series and my ass couldn’t watch past the first quarter. I apologize I was wrong. @BradyHawk305 Brady spot on. Taking the jumpers Jokic is allowing only plays into his &amp; the nuggets game since that lets him stay on the floor longer. He defends drives by going overtop rather than meeting his defender. I’d like to see everyone on the Heat attack Jokic as much as possible @missmewithdatQ @PercyStaffin @BleacherReport So I don’t care about them being a 8 seed making my point stronger the heat weren’t even picked to win any series an easy finals opponent for the nuggets, the media picked the nuggets to win outside of one media guy lakers started the season off 2-10 😂 a 13th seed 3 weeks befor Drake Has Placed Massive Bets On The Nuggets To Win The NBA Finals In Five Games Over The Heat https://t.co/now03Lwa5A @NBA @NBA2K Bam is not even comparable to Joker; there’s an MVP and a Heat player. Nuggets have proved they’re different and play to win regardless of the team; ask KD  Steph, Berkeley, LeBron why their got respect for the Joker. The Heat shot 34.4% from three-point range during the regular season (and the Nuggets held opponents to 34.4% from three). They shot 33.3% last night. Their shooting performance was exactly what we should expect. Tonight's Heat at Nuggets game is brought to you by Tucker McNear Swanson Carlson's spicy peanuts. https://t.co/q0ZtcJsYB2 @Michigan305 @MiamiHEAT LOL, Nuggets had thier lowest scoring game of the playoffs. Nuggets will shoot better as will the heat but if you think that was a perfect game from the Nuggets you have not seen them when they are on. Heat need to challenge the hoop more and stop chucking 3's @LeBatardShow @__ChrisCote @MichaelRyanRuiz @10DayTony  The Heat made more 3s and shot a better percentage from 3 than the Nuggets. If they put Love in MPJ would be on him as he is 2 inches taller allowing Jokic to be in the paint. #NuevoDía | 🏀Finales de la NBA | #Nuggets ganan el primero. @NBALatam, @NBAspain, @nuggets

Quem leva essa? #Nuggets ou #Heat ?

Meu palpite é que dá Denver. A análise de Erik Spoelstra sobre a performance do ataque do Heat, no pós-jogo de ontem:

"Você tem que dar crédito a eles [Nuggets] com seu tamanho, por realmente proteger e trazer um terceiro defensor no garrafão. As coisas precisam ser feitas com muito mais intenção e muito mais ritmo, muito mais detalhes. Somos um time agressivo e ofensivo, então, se não estamos tendo esse tipo de oportunidade na aro ou na linha de lance livre, temos que encontrar maneiras diferentes de fazer isso". Nuggets vence facilmente Heat e sai na frente da decisão https://t.co/6pJ5ZSixVw Con un magistral triple doble de Nikola Jokic, los Denver Nuggets derrotaron 104-93 a los Miami Heat en la primera final de la NBA. https://t.co/eOPXrKmwYH Nikola Jokic got a triple-double in his NBA Finals debut, Jamal Murray scored 26 points and the Denver Nuggets had little trouble with the cold-shooting Miami Heat on the way https://t.co/knWhqTUdpi The Miami Heat shot 2 Free Throws last night….

The Nuggets size was going to be the challenge for the Heat and it showed a lot last night. Heat couldn't keep it close. We will see how they adjust moving forward. #nbafinals @DTSports33 @BenDTSPodcast probably, but it's also just one game, and the Nuggets had 9 days off, the Heat played 4 games during that time @HoopSpaces They're too small so their margin for error is slim... The Nuggets can shoot like shit from outside and still win... The Heat cannot @BostonConnr @tyschmit @evanfoxy @VivalaZito Jokic staring at a horses ass then getting off the carriage and rocking the Miami Heat to sleep. #nuggetsin4 Me either after what they did last night struts 0- 12 😳 how do u lose this pathetic 8 seeded heat team doesn’t even belong on the same court as the nuggets @NickHertzogInc Wow, the praise from Simmons and LeBron just goes to show how dominant the Nuggets are. But don't count out the Heat, they have a game plan to take down Jokic and come out on top in five games. 🔥🔥🏀 Click my profile plz "TENEMOS QUE ATACAR EL ARO MUCHO MÁS"

Jimmy Butler, estrella del Miami Heat, tras la caída ante Nuggets en el juego 1 en la final de la #NBAxESPN, destacó que deben hacer ajustes para tener mejores opciones de ganar el segundo partido de la serie.

Nuggets 104- Heat 93
El equipo de Miami  no encontró la manera de frenar a Jokic. https://t.co/5Ihd66o4p0 If in the 2023 NBA Finals, the Denver Nuggets were leading the Miami Heat 3-0, but then the Heat staged a comeback and won the series 4-3. Can we consider this the ultimate script? https://t.co/TwgNKcUkND @boomer17771 @jagleoian @nuggets @MiamiHEAT Lo único que me queda de esperanza es que el Heat no puede jugar peor que hoy jaja If the heat beat the nuggets, would truly be one of the biggest upsets I’ve ever see .

Nuggets are the best team they’ve played, are clicking on all cylinders, and have an insane home court advantage in the altitude.

It would be shocking if the heat even win 2 Denver Nuggets and Miami Heat big clash at the NBA playoffs arena!

Watched the Heat-Nuggets game last night.

1U Miami Heat +2.5 series spread +110 (Ceasars)

As I said in my write-up last night for my 2.5U first half play, I will be taking the Heat series spread since the Nuggets won the game and won handily. Looked everywhere for +3.5 but couldn't find it. Heat spread for game 2 is already down to +8.5 from +9.5, and I really like their chances to steal one in game 2. Spo ain't going out in 5 games 🔥 Miami Heat vs. Denver Nuggets picks, predictions: Who wins Game 2 of NBA Finals? https://t.co/5aOhWIVX0y @miagiants @zachcomposto @ben_guerrant @currypistonn i will make a real life $1000 bet the nuggets win, from a non bias standpoint the heat would need tons of variable to go there way to even have a chance at winning this Heat got one of those Lakers moral victories. Nuggets have seven straight real victories. It’s the busiest month of the NBA season!

@KevinOConnorNBA dishes his thoughts on Nuggets-Heat, Ja Morant, the 2023 NBA draft, and the bold coaching changes out of Milwaukee and Philly: https://t.co/pxdkN86cnF I’m seeing a lot of Heat fans who ain’t learned from LA with these “moral win” ass mentality😂😭😭 O melhor do Jogo 1 das #NBAFinals já está no Youtube! 📺

Você confere TUDO que rolou na vitória do Denver Nuggets contra o Miami Heat! 👀

Acesse: https://t.co/ZXFNiTcg5w https://t.co/0z0cksPlli the heat still lost by double digits when the nuggets shot 28% from 3 Nuggets star Nikola Jokic gasses up Heat defense after dominating NBA Finals Game 1 win – NBA News https://t.co/PBJbop4k9H #2Jun #UrgenteVenezuela 

🚨En su debut en la final de la NBA, Denver Nuggets consiguió el primer triunfo de su historia en esta instancia, 93-104 sobre Miami Heat. El equipo de Colorado está a 3 victorias de un anillo histórico.

Con información Miguel Santana. https://t.co/q4hrlgRyeJ Sets ran for Nuggets players when Heat were in zone (21 possessions):

Jokic, 5
Murray, 4
Porter, 3
Brown, 3
Green, 3

Others, 3

Probably going to be a Bruce Brown/Jeff Green 'game' each Nuggets home game. Jeff Green props for G2 would be nice, Brown over adjusted now. Heat fans not impressed by Nuggets despite Game 1 blowout https://t.co/aL377qg5Qy its gonna go like this, 
game 1: nuggets
game 2: nuggets 
game 3: heat
game 4: nuggets 
game 5: heat 
game 6: nuggets 🏆 What an W from the nuggets my prediction for the next game will be the heat. Não satisfeita a ESPN atacou novamente, segundo o mesmo apontamento o Miami Heat tem 11% de chances de vencer o Denver Nuggets, ainda não dá para saber se a ESPN matriz está errada. Nenhuma dessas atuações foi pelo Miami Heat ou Denver Nuggets. Em fevereiro de 2023 o Heat perdeu pela segunda vez para o Nuggets, por 112 a 108 com Nikola Jokic sendo o grande destaque da partida com um duplo-duplo de 27 pontos e 12 rebotes, pelo Heat Jimmy Butler também com um duplo-duplo de 24 pontos e 10 rebotes. O primeiro encontro aconteceu em Dezembro de 2022 (124 a 119), com o Tyler Hero sendo o cestinha do Heat com um Duplo-Duplo, 26 pontos e 10 rebotes. Do lado do Nuggets o maior pontuador foi Kentavious Caldwell-Pope com 20 pontos, porém 8 jogadores fizeram pelo menos 10 pontos. + #07 Nuggets x Heat - Retrospecto

Na temporada 2022-23 da NBA, por estarem em conferências diferentes, as duas franquias se enfrentaram duas vezes, com o Denver Nuggets vencendo as duas oportunidades. + Denver Nuggets e Miami Heat, se enfrentam em uma série melhor de sete pelas finais da NBA 2022-23

Pensando nisso resolvemos trazer 10 fatos sobre as finais da NBA. 

Segue o fio 👇🏿 https://t.co/LO9qrz4bPf @Just_Jasoon @NBAMemes Nobody cares about lakers and Celtics they are washed! Heat and Nuggets way more exciting! Watching the lakers play the nuggets felt like I was watching geriatric basketball 🏀 so slow and no pace at all. @RustyBUCKETS321 Yeah sorry, but the Nuggets haven't played any team worth two shits. Trash Wolves. Suns was competitive until their leader, CP3, got hurt. Lakers were a fake good team the entire way. Heat are in the Finals because they injured Giannis. They lucked out. Like GSW last year. I wish the heat were playing someone else tbh.

I just can’t find a reason to hate the nuggets 🤣. #NBAFinals Nuggets 104x93 Heat (1x0)

Vi até o 3° período e dormi https://t.co/ryBuJvQHWu @StudyHallSharp Lol bro have you not acknowledged these games are all scripted? When the heat run the Nuggets in game 2 and Martin drops 18-20 come back to this tweet! @Goof0x coz y'all were not driving enough to the rim, Nuggets defense is ass I don't know why Heat kept on shooting threes when they had wide open layups @StoolGreenie Dude the Nuggets are better than the Heat and Celtics. Heats numbers will be worse because they are playing a much better team with a better coach. I’m a lakers fan and they absolutely stomped us. Nuggets would have beaten the Celtics in 5 or 6. All of the things in the What's Happening bar are stupid today except for the Nuggets beating the Heat. That was pretty cool. Go Nuggets. I see one more tweet from Heat fans like this and imma really start rooting for the Nuggets lol. Bucks fans have did nothing but root for these bums lol PODCAST NO AR! Hoje fizemos um preview da Final da NBA entre Denver Nuggets e Miami Heat com muitas das coisas que realmente apareceram no Jogo 1. 

Também nos despedimos do Celtics e comentamos os novos técnicos de Sixers, Pistons e Bucks! https://t.co/XkLPspeeu7 @stickybunnn Nuggets in 5. 

Denver played terrible in the 2nd half. They should have won by 20 +. 

Celtics had the Heat and choked it away. Heat are coming back down to earth. 

Martin, Strus and Duncan all played way above their norm. Reality is setting in. @Arthur_Bogosian You forgot to mention 
“The 1st seeded, underdogs with a 2x league mvp on the team, Denver nugget”. Super proud of them, I don’t think anyone saw them beating the 8th seeded Miami heat that currently has zero mvp players. I don't know a damn thing about sports so "heat at nuggets" sounds like an ancient invocation to me https://t.co/FNOc2cTu1o Denver (EE.UU.),.- Los Denver Nuggets firmaron este jueves un estreno soñado en las primeras Finales de su historia y sometieron con autoridad a los Miami Heat para tomar ventaja en la lucha por el anillo de la NBA (104-93, 1-0 en la serie).

https://t.co/J1Sln0Cm0J https://t.co/Eg8FS7IVim The Brewers lost another series on the road yesterday, this time with one against the 4th-place team in the AL East while the Denver Nuggets played and won their first ever NBA Finals game last night. Also, they dominated the Miami Heat in 3 out of 4 quarters yesterday. Heat just looked out matched last night. Nuggets in 4, Heat don’t got enough. @RyB_311 maybe espn doesn't like the nuggets and the heat 🤔 U can’t say the heat will shoot better and that will help us next game and not also acknowledge that the nuggets 3 pt shooting was not great either. There’s will improve as well. Not that simple What's our thoughts on the Nuggets Heat series .Predictions ? Yeah man let the heat win 3-1 and let the nuggets have to fight for every game then it’ll be exciting to watch 😭 Talking heads can’t find enough topics around Nuggets Vs Heat 😂😂😂😂, it has to either be pure hoops , or the most outlandish shii ever (I bet they do is Jimmy A Greater Heat than Lebron if he wins the title) 🚨 Nuevo Podcast en @ivoox 🚨

https://t.co/nfAmWIkE9M I like #Nuggets &amp; #Heat slight edge to #BringItIn however
1. Miami missed a lot of WIDE OPEN SHOTS
2. #HEATCulture 17 more shots
3. Heat made 5 more 3's

Difference is FREE THROWS. Although I slightly prefer Denver, you're telling me the Heat were only fouled TWICE?! #NBAFinals N'empêche si le Heat arrive à battre les Nuggets et être champion NBA faut que Netflix fasse un reportage sur cet année ça va être une masterclass https://t.co/q9k5nemaw2 Stephen A Smith shows respect to both the Miami Heat and the Denver Nuggets but picks Denver to get it done in 6 games.
#MileHighBasketball #BringItIn https://t.co/JJnEpje0CD @NBAMemes I love the nuggets ball movement but I also knew nuggets were gonna cook heat. Nuggets-Celtics would have been a 7 game series I think @patgreedy I never said hear in 6 …I said nuggets in 6 . I said the heat can win this series if nuggets play unserious basketball Heat held the Nuggets to 45 points in the second half last night. They figured things out defensively in that second half. Now we need the open threes to start falling. These 2 days off in between games is gonna do the Heat so good. Game 2 gonna be 🔥🔥🔥
#HEATCulture @RealSkipBayless @undisputed Nuggets in 4.   They have no size to match up with Denver.   Jokic will continue to pick the Heat apart and exploit the mismatches Jokic gets triple-double, Nuggets roll past Heat 104-93 in Game 1 of NBA Finals https://t.co/onOIXlXcdq saying nice things about the Miami Heat is not an insult to the Denver Nuggets.  Thanks for attending my Ted talk Going the distance in that last series ultimately did damage to the Miami Heat...the Nuggets had plenty of time to rest up. #NBAFinals Miami Heat is a phenomenal team. They are the 8 seed in the #NBAPlayoffs but have won every Game 1 in the playoff. Until yesterday when they lost to the Nuggets - Gm 1.

This to me is why the Nuggets are not just the best team in the @NBA, rightly No. 1 seed, but will be Champs. How Heat can hit back against Nuggets + Adam Silver's Ja Morant gaffe – NBA News https://t.co/IZMFnXWFmA I have a confession to make. #NBAFinals I rarely do this, which is why I said I was making the long shot pick... I pretty much made up everything I tweeted on the fly, as far as the Heat versus Nuggets pick. I honestly think the Nuggets are the better team. But, I'd really like to see Jimmy Butler win one. Therefore, I improvised a scenario in my head to fit that desired outcome. Some if the takes coming out of game 1 are insane. The Heat are missing the same shots they’ve been missing all playoffs the only difference is the Nuggets are the most balanced offensive team they’ve faced. @nuggets will sweep the Heat back to Miami. The 2023 NBA Finals is set! 🏀🔥 The Miami Heat closed out a nail-biting Eastern Conference finals series against the Boston Celtics and they go head-to-head with the formidable Denver Nuggets for the championship title.

👇🏻Echadle un vistazo

#NBA #NBAPlayoffs @petemrogers @nuggets @MiamiHEAT @NBA @unimockups Bro I’m a heat fan but that nuggets jersey is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 @undisputed @ShannonSharpe We need the heat nuggets to go to game 7 so we can keep Shannon as much as we can .@RealSkipBayless reacts to the Nuggets Game 1 win over the Heat: https://t.co/QNSyrlIWmZ Miami heat took 20 more shots than the nuggets too and got cooked still Welp. The @nuggets squad still so hyped off breaking LeBron the fraud and taking him down in the West Finals, they just may decide to sweep the Heat too. LeFraud will LOVE that bc IF Butler beats Nuggets with no superteam AND no help from league&amp;refs, LeBron is trash on this app. @BassonCracker @RobertsCooking Why are you still talking about the 3-0 when you're in the finals, and why are so many heat fans content with getting steamrolled by the nuggets
